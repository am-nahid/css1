    <h2>What is CSS ?</h2>
    <ol  >
        <li class="para1" >CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li class="para1">CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li class="para1"><span class="para2"><b>Css is not neccesary.</b></span><span class="para3"><b>CSS saves a lot of work.</b></span><span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</span></li>
        <li class="para4" >External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="head2">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="para6">Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
        <li class="para6">Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li class="para6">External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li class="para6">The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles is external CSS files. However, <span class="para7">in this tutorial we will use inline and external styles,</span> <span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</span></li>
    </ul>
   
    <p class="para12">When compairing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="para12">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p class="para12">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
